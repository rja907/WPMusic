# Music

An app that uses Webpack for Vendor Asset Caching, Vendor Splitting, Code Splitting and Chunk Hashing for Cache Busting.

Repo workflow:

`Make changes in the webpack.config.js file to bundle js files.`

`Make changes in the webpack.config.js file to bundle css files.`

`Run 'npm run build'.`

The application will also be deployed on Multiple platforms.

This will solidify someone's grasp over Webpack.
